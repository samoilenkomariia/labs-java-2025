The first 10 years of development I wrote terrible code myself, although I read Butch and Knut, studied at a university as a programmer, worked on large projects for oil and gas transportation (PPDMN, Ukrnafta), the Ministry of Emergency Situations (Ministry of Emergency Situations), the Civil Registry Office and public organizations. But I had neither a mentor nor anyone to compare my strengths with, there was no professional environment, no one reviewed my code or criticized my decisions. I gained a lot of experience, wrote fluently in 8 languages ​​(first Asm x86, wrote a lot in dBase, Pascal, C++ Builder, Delphi), but professional growth was very slow, everything was on my own.

The second 10 years I had older friends who could suggest something and criticize, subordinates who also needed help, and I started teaching, which dramatically improved my own code. I started managing a large team and had to write code that everyone in the team could understand, and students had to write even easier. During this period, I grew a lot professionally, read 10 times more, professionally mastered only three languages: C#, JavaScript and PHP, started writing open source, articles, giving presentations at conferences, speaking to large audiences, including in English, in other countries. I managed teams in products for the USA, China, Europe.

For the third decade, I knew for sure that I wanted to devote myself completely to Open Source and training professionals. During this time, I conducted 269 offline meetups, recorded more than 2,000 video lectures, trained 11 node.js contributors, launched the development of the Metarhia technology stack, which has hundreds of contributors and has been implemented in many projects in corporate systems, the public sector, interactive television video formats, sociology, medicine and transport, and received international awards. I was the architect of the unified information system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. I taught at three universities and lectured to more than 10 thousand students. I made more than 150 reports, organized international conferences.

What I learned from these 30 years of experience, what is important and what would have helped me move faster if I had known it from the very beginning:
- Long will - the ability to deeply study a specialty, not superficial copying, is the foundation of professional growth.
- Teaching others is the best way to understand a topic and get criticism of your code, learn to do it simpler and explain how it works, and then rework it even easier.
- Open source is an opportunity to get feedback from the community and show your level of expertise, benefit and save your work for multiple reuse.
- Public speaking - developing the skills of explaining complex concepts in simple words and building a reputation as an interesting speaker gave me more than popularity, it allowed me to train the skills of open professional conversation, which is needed in negotiations and discussions.
- Code reviews teach us more than writing it, and the reviews we do and receive.
- You need to write as simply as possible - complex code speaks of the immaturity of the engineer, of the inability to divide the task into parts and apply the full power of the language, platform and hardware.
- Multi-paradigm programming has won - the ability to combine different paradigms and get code with the desired characteristics is key for all modern languages, none of them lives in isolation.
- The fight between paradigms is pointless - each paradigm is strong in its own way, it is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses and form a set of ideas, syntaxes, abstractions and techniques for the task.
- The basic engineering principle of SoC (Separation of concerns) is the basis of predictable and maintainable code, and patterns are not theory, but concentrated practice and wisdom, sharpened for reuse, not tied to the language and platform.
- Kindness is more important than knowledge, and toxicity, pride and hatred destroy everything they touch.
